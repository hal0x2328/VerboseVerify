## VerboseVerify
A neo-cli plugin to provide extended information about transaction verification failures during the `sendrawtransaction` RPC method

### Introduction
There are 20+ reasons a Neo transaction may fail verification, but the Neo RPC server by default only gives generic
error messages, such as the dreaded `Block or transaction validation failed`, leaving the developer on their own to 
figure out exactly what is wrong with their transaction syntax. The VerboseVerify plugin intercepts `sendrawtransaction`
requests and runs them through the same transaction verification process used by the Neo core, except it provides 
specific information about the exact failure condition. If the pre-verification step passes, the transaction continues
to be verified and processed as normal by the core code.

### Installation

cd VerboseVerify
dotnet publish -c Release
